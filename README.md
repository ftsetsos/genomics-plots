My attempts at beautiful python plotting for genomics

I have been scavenging the web for python plotting for genomics, but my search was fruitless.

So here is my attempt to fill the gap by introducing some scripts to create nice and clear cut plots for genomics, while retaining usability.

Extra python packages that are required for the scripts:

matplotlib (install with $ pip install matplotlib)

scipy (install with $ pip install scipy)

brewer2mpl (install with $ pip install brewer2mpl)
