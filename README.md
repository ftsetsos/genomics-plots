My scripts using python and R plotting for genomics

So here is my attempt to fill the gap by introducing some scripts to create nice and clear cut plots for genomics, while retaining usability.

Extra python packages that are required for the scripts (among others - need updating):

matplotlib (install with $ pip install matplotlib)

scipy (install with $ pip install scipy)

brewer2mpl (install with $ pip install brewer2mpl)
